# Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with Diffusion Models

This is the code for the paper: "A Geometric View of Data Complexity: Efficient Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with Diffusion Models", and contains our Fokker-Planck-based local intrinsic dimension estimator called *FLIPD* (Pronounced as "flipped", the acronym is a rearrangement of "FP" from Fokker-Planck and "LID" for local intrinsic dimension).

## Code Coming Soon ...
